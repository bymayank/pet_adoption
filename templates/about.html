        <p class="text">
            Helping vulnerable animals and keeping pets in safe and loving homes requires a commitment from all of us advocates, pet owners, shelters, leaders, and entire communities. When we work together under a common cause, weâ€™re both saving lives and elevating our society and its laws to ensure cruelty victims and other at-risk animals receive the protection and care they deserve.
